# 🧠 Hey, I’m YogurtFusion  

A curious web-dev-in-training who codes like caffeine powers creativity — a little chaotic, very effective, and somehow always gets it done.  

I build web things, learn fast, and treat AI like a co-pilot — not a crutch.  

---

## 🔭 What I’m Working On  

- Polishing a portfolio of small, real-world projects (responsive UIs, accessible components, and audio players that *actually* work).  
- Prepping for web dev internships — sharpening skills in **Git**, **React**, **MongoDB**, and using **AI** to speed up (not skip) the work.  

---

## 🌱 What I’m Learning  

- **Front-end:** React, Tailwind, accessibility, and modular JavaScript that doesn’t break when you blink.  
- **Back-end:** MongoDB + Next.js basics for a smooth full-stack flow.  
- **Tooling:** Git workflows and build tools that don’t make me want to scream into the void.  

---

## 👯 Open to Collaborate On  

- Small, purposeful web apps and reusable UI components.  
- Music/media player projects or anything that helps me flex backend muscles (Node/Express, I’m looking at you).  

---

## 🤔 I’d Love Help With  

- Real-world project feedback — code reviews, accessibility, performance tips.  
- Internship prep: technical interviews, portfolio reviews, you name it.  

---

## 💬 Ask Me About  

- Front-end debugging, layout quirks, and why **CSS Grid > Flexbox** when you know what you’re doing.  
- How to integrate AI into your workflow *without* letting it do all your thinking for you.
