Hi there 👋

I’m YogurtFusion — a curious web-dev-in-training who codes like coffee fuels neurons: messy, effective, and surprisingly productive.
I build web stuff, learn fast, and use AI as my co-pilot (not my crutch).

🔭 What I’m working on

Polishing a portfolio of small, real-world projects (responsive UIs, accessible components, audio players).

Preparing for web dev internships: focus on HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Git, and practical use of AI to speed up workflows.

🌱 What I’m learning

Core CS fundamentals: OOP, data structures, recursion, algorithm analysis — the 20% that gives 80% of results.

Modern front-end: semantic HTML, CSS Grid/Flex, accessibility, and modular JS.

Build tools & Git workflows that don’t make me cry.

👯 Looking to collaborate on

Small web apps, UI components, and music/media player features.

Projects where I can learn backend basics (Node/Express) or improve full-stack understanding.

🤔 Where I need help

Real-world project reviews (code, accessibility, performance).

Interview prep and guidance on getting that first internship.

💬 Ask me about

Front-end debugging, responsive layout quirks, CSS Grid > Flex when used right.

How to blend AI into your workflow without losing learning signal.

⚡ Fun fact

I obsess over tiny UX details — a smoother microinteraction makes me irrationally happy.
